  <h1>Privacy Policy for AFT Calculator</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 16 September 2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>ReaperDevs LLC</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the AFT Calculator mobile application (the "App"). Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it by being transparent about our practices.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Handle</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Information We Do Not Collect:</strong> We design our App with your privacy as a priority. We <strong>do not</strong> personally collect, store, or transmit any of the fitness data you enter into the App. All calculations are performed locally on your device.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Information Handled by Third Parties:</strong> The free version of the App uses Google AdMob, which collects data to serve personalized ads. This data may include your device's advertising ID and IP address. We do not use any other third-party services for analytics or data collection.
  </p>
    
  <h2>3. Third-Party Services (Google AdMob)</h2>
  <p>
    To support the free version of the App, we use Google AdMob. For more information on how Google collects and uses your data, please review their policies:
    <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Your Privacy Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Opting Out of Personalized Ads:</strong> You can opt out of receiving personalized ads by adjusting your device's settings. On Android, navigate to <strong>Settings > Google > Ads</strong> and choose to "Delete advertising ID" or "Reset advertising ID."
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Jurisdiction-Specific Rights (GDPR/CCPA):</strong> Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, such as the right to access or delete your data. Since we do not collect your personal data, these rights primarily apply to the data collected by Google AdMob. Please refer to their privacy policies and your device's privacy settings to exercise these rights.
  </p>

  <h2>5. In-App Purchase to Remove Ads</h2>
  <p>
    The App offers a one-time in-app purchase to provide an ad-free experience. This transaction is processed securely through the Google Play Store. ReaperDevs LLC does not collect or have access to any of your financial information.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable administrative and technical measures to safeguard the integrity and security of our App. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
