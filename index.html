  <h1>Privacy Policy for AFT Calculator</h1>

  <p>
    Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information is handled by the AFT Calculator app ("the app").
  </p>

  <h2>Core App Functionality</h2>
  <p>
    AFT Calculator does not collect, store, or share any of the personal fitness data you enter.
    All calculations (such as scores, age, gender, and event results) are performed locally on your device and are not transmitted to any external servers. The core calculator functionality works completely offline.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app does not require or request any form of user login, location data, or personal user identifiers for its primary purpose.
  </p>

  <h2>Advertisements (Google AdMob)</h2>
  <p>
    The free version of this app is supported by advertisements from Google AdMob.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google AdMob may collect and use data to provide you with more relevant, personalized advertising. This data can include your device's advertising ID, IP address, and other information related to your device and app usage. We do not share any of the fitness data you enter into the calculator with Google AdMob.
  </p>
  <p>
    For more information on how Google collects and uses your data for advertising, please review their policies:

  </ul>

  <h2>In-App Purchase to Remove Ads</h2>
  <p>
    The app offers a one-time in-app purchase to remove all advertisements. This transaction is processed securely through the Google Play Store. We do not collect or store any personal financial information. Once the purchase is complete, the app will no longer display ads from Google AdMob.
